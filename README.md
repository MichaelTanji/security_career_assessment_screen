# Security Career Assessment Screen

## The Idea

A cognitive ability or "Wonderlic"-type<sup>1</sup> test to assess whether someone is likely to succeed in a career in cybersecurity (role immaterial). It assumes no prior knowledge of security or technology, and addresses aptitudes, traits, and dispositions that successful practitioners are known to exhibit and managers of security practitioners are known to value.

## Task

Given a 30 question test, answer as many questions as possible in the allotted time.

## Conditions

A copy of the test, an answer sheet (or online form), 15 minutes.

## Standard

Achieve a score of at least 18 points overall, and at least three points in each domain.

## Measured Traits

Curiosity, Capacity, Creativity, Determination, Humility, Empathy

**Curiosity:** A great deal of security work involves solving mysteries of one type or another. Without a sense of curiosity you have no hope of identifying root causes.

**Capacity:** Addressing the talent issue means (among other things) growing the workforce from the ground-up. The ability to pick up on theories and concepts without prior knowledge suggests an ability to get to a given state knowledge-wise.

**Creativity:** Sometimes there is no solution; you have to invent it. There is no textbook or prior lessons-learned; you have to be the test case. Whether one finds themselves on the offensive or defensive side of the security equation, the ability to overcome "everyone knows" thinking and develop novel approaches is an invaluable skill.

**Determination:** Rare is the security problem that has a clear-cut and easy-to-implement solution. Rare is the security issue that has a clear-cut and readily understandable root cause. You have to be willing and able to hammer away until the job is done.

**Humility:** No one knows it all, and if you operate as if you do you're setting yourself, and those you serve, up for a painful fall. The first step in countering 'rock star' culture is getting people to have the right mindset.

**Empathy:** You're in security to help people. People who don't know as much as you do. People who have real problems that impact their lives. Taking the time to walk a mile in their shoes will produce better outcomes.
