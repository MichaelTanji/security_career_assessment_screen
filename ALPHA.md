## Curiosity

Your widget is broken. You walk through the troubleshooting steps in the widget manual but it still doesn’t work. Your next step is:

* Google
* Call the widget manufacturer’s 1-800 number
* Try to find someone who owns the same widget and ask them
* Take the widget back to the store for a new one

You’ve been making widgets for 10 years. Your family has made widgets going back five generations. By chance you meet someone who also makes widgets, but using a totally different technique and materials. Your initial response is: 

* Are you seriously going to tell me how to make widgets?
* I’ve never heard of widgets being made like that. How does it work?
* I’m not interested, but I’m glad it's working for you.
* Whatever you’re doing, it's not making widgets.

You get a job in a widget factory and as a part of your training are shown exactly the steps to take, and buttons to push on the widget making machine. Of the 20 different potential settings on the machine, you only regularly use 7. When your shift is over the factory is winding down for the night, you…

* Clean up and head for the parking lot.
* Throw some scrap widget material in the machine and see what those other 13 settings do.
* Talk to your supervisor to see if he’ll show you what those other 13 settings do.
* Dig out the widget machine manual and take it home to read.

How often do you teach yourself how to make or do something?

* I’m the king of YouTube how-to videos. Half the stuff I own I made myself.
* I once tried to screw in a lightbulb. I mostly sit in the dark now.
* I’m a classroom kind of person. If there isn’t a teacher are you really learning anything?

You’ve just got your new flat-pack furniture home, opened the box, and found that two pages in the instructions are missing. Your next course of action is?

Spend another two hours in the car going back to the store for a complete copy of the directions.
Go online to try and find a copy of the directions.
Follow the directions as far as you can, and then test fit the remaining pieces to see if you can do it without directions.
Call your brother in law over to help out; he bought the same piece of furniture six months ago.

## Determination

You’re in your doctor’s waiting room and the only thing to do to pass the time is a crossword in a children’s magazine. It is surprisingly difficult for the 8-12 year old audience it is supposed to be for:

* Keep at it until you’ve solved it. Tear out the puzzle page and take it home if you have to. Fuck you Highlights!
* Do what you can and leave it for the next patient.
* Put it down and look at the tropical fish in the wall tank.
* Ask the receptionist for something else to read; you’re a g-d adult!


You are a part of a team that is responsible for planting 100 trees. You plant 75 trees by lunch. After lunch, you’re the only one to show up. Your next step is:

* Start planting sucker
* Wait till the rest of the team shows up
* Plant for a while, then look for the other members of the team, repeat.
* Pack it up. It sounds like you missed some instructions otherwise the rest of the team would be here by now.


You’ve got a solid GPA and great test scores. Your first choice for college rejected you, but you got into your safety school. Right now you’re feeling...

* Rejected and despondent.
* Let down but not worried. You can always try to transfer later.
* Disappointed. The Ivy League was the first step to life in the fast lane. I guess it's mediocrity FTW.
* There is always the Navy

## Ingenuity

You know nothing about the field of X. How do you go about getting a job in the field?

* Read/study as much as I can, join X groups and absorb as much knowledge as I can. Try to get an entry-level gig somewhere.
* Find a graduate/undergraduate program, apply, network, hit the job fairs before graduation.
*  Asfafs
* Asfa

At work, when you get done with your assigned tasks, your first instinct is to:

* Take on more work.
* Figure out how to make my job easier.
* Help others with their work.
* Work on something I want to not have to.

Your workplace has suggestion boxes everywhere. The boss always says his door is open to talk about new ideas and ways of doing things. 

* That’s what every boss says; they don’t mean it. They’re not going to mess with what got them where they are.
* Bob brought an idea to the boss once and a month later he was fired.
* Bob brought an idea to the boss once, they tried it and it failed miserably.


You supervise a team of 10 people. One of them comes to you with a new idea for how to do their job. Your first instinct is to:

* Remind them that there is one approved way to do the job and that they could get in trouble for changing things up.
* Point out the risks involved in doing things differently.
* Listen to the idea, assess its worthiness and compliance with organizational standards and goals, and let them try.
* Explain the new process to the other nine people and let everyone benefit from the new approach.


## Problem Solving

You need to connect two computers together. The first system uses the notional ALPHA type of port to connect to other devices; the second system uses the notional GAMMA type of port to connect to other devices. You have four cables with different types of connectors on either end: ALPHA to ALPHA (1), ALPHA to BRAVO (2); GAMMA to BRAVO (3); and GAMMA to ALPHA (4). Which cables do you need to connect the two computers together?

* 1, 2, 3
* 1, 2
* 4
* 3, 4

## Humility

Your work on a project was minimal. The project took off though, and it has become something of a global phenomenon. When people find out you were a part of the project you feel:

* Proud
* Ashamed
* Conflicted
* Embarrassed

You made a mistake, but didn’t realize it at the time. The mistake became public and circumstances are such that someone else is getting all the blame. This is not a trivial matter and the repercussions could be severe.

* Better them than me.
* Reveal the source of the problem anonymously and without naming names. The problem will get fixed and no one has to get in trouble.
* Own up and take what’s coming.
* Admit that you had _a_ role in what happened, but spread the blame around. They can’t punish everyone.

You’re assigned to a project with two people who have less experience and skill than you do. Your first instinct is to:

* Start working and call on the other two people as needed.
* Find out the desired end state, assess the skill level of the other two, and break down tasks accordingly.
* Start work on the parts you want to work on and give the rest to the other two.
* Explain the risks of allowing inexperienced people to work on the project and ask for more senior people. 

Empathy/Perspective

When someone comes to you with a problem your first instinct is to:

* Tell them to read the manual or look up the issue online. People need to learn how to help themselves, and in an age of instant information this is easier than ever.
* Help them as best I can, looking up what the problem might be and working through the troubleshooting steps with them. This way they’re more comfortable solving problems on their own in the future.
* Direct them to the manufacturer or service provider for help; they get paid for that sort of thing.
* Take a quick look and tell them it's fucked and that they need a new machine.

Five blind people are placed in different positions around an elephant. Each person puts their hands on the elephant. How many different descriptions of an elephant might you get?

* 3, they can only realistically depict the trunk, legs and tail.
* 10, 5 people, 2 hands each.
* 5, five people, five descriptions
* 1, how do you misinterpret what an elephant looks like?

You’re briefing the boss about a problem. Failure to address the problem could lead to a material event. Is it OK to lie a little bit about how bad the problem is if you know the boss would otherwise blow it off?

* Yes. You’re the expert and your opinion on these matters should prevail.
* No. It's never OK to lie.
* Yes. Lying is not a crime. You’re doing the right thing.
* No. Your job is to inform. If company leadership wants to accept the risk, that’s on them.
