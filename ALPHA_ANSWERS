1. Goolge. With the exception of returning the widget to the store as a first move, the remaining three answers are reasonable, but the best measure of determination is trying to figure it out for yourself, and in this day and age that means using search to look for answers.

2. Like the previous question, we're looking for a sense of determination and curiosity, which means looking for the answer yourself and trying things out before you go running for a helping hand. 

3. The time that has passed since a given point in time.

4. 4. None of the other cables will connect the two systems; 4 is simply the systems in reverse as previously described.

5. Bleeding. This is an exercise in being able to assess the criticality of a situation and prioritize accordingly. Shortness of breath means she's still breathing; pain is to be expected; none of us will last long if we lose too much blood.

6. European date convetions are day/month/year, so: 25/12/25.

7. #2. You are looking for people who are open to new ideas and ways of doing things. The other answers are dismissive of new ways of thinking/doing, and display a lack of humility.

8. #2. Strikes a balance between following conventions and acceptable methods, and incorporating new ideas and techniques. Neither extreme rigidity nor complete lack of discipline are desired traits.

9. #2 Again, lookin for someone who is open to new ideas, not dismissive of different ways of doing things, and not going to take out their frustrations on others just because they don't agree on an approach.

10. #1 Tongue in cheek, but you want someone who won't give up. 

11. #3. You want people to admit their mistakes and help to address them, not hide them (allowing them to fester) or other actions that may poison the workplace or sow discord and distrust. Rarely are mistakes fatal, and regardless of their nature they are all opportunities to learn.

12. #3 Maybe you heard wrong, maybe not, but not trying to make progress or putting the onus on others when you have a chance to help isn't acceptable. 

13. #2. You can't let setbacks derail your entire effort. Its OK to feel down and out, that's natural, but the route towards a solution is rarely a straight line. In the end, nobody is going to care how you got there, only that you made it.

14. #1.

Your supervisor gives you a task to complete. She tells you what she wants done verbally, and hands you a sheet of paper with specific directions on it. What do you do next?

* Read the directions, integrate what you read with what you were told, and begin work.
* Follow the directions; she may have forgotten a step.
* Follow her verbal directions; she knows what sheâ€™s doing and probably knows what directions can be skipped to get done faster.
* Read the directions, identify any discrepancies between the written directions and the verbal ones, find your supervisor and ask for clarification before beginning.

15. #3. Search is great, but its not the be-all, end-all. Results are only as good as the algorithm used, and the available information. If the answer you're looking for isn't online, search isn't going to help.Biases.

16. You want to study X, but you can't afford to go to school full time. Your next step is:

* Study on your own as much as you can; join X discussion groups; build up a reputation and then start applying for jobs.
* Try to get an entry-level job in a company that does X, even if it isn't directly involved in X.
* Find a commercial training/certification program in X. Its not as expensive as a degree but its better than nothing.
* Study on your own as much as you can; work on small personal projects in X and share them; apply for jobs.

17. Any answer is acceptable, but #2 speaks to one's drive or sense of efficiency; #3 speaks to one's willingness to collaborate or selflessness; #1 speaks to drive in general, but is a potential recepie for burn-out; #4 speaks to one's self-motivation.

18. #4. It's the boss's company and their the one who determines the course of action. You may end up the hero, or a zero, but the idea that you would let a potential breakthrough languish because its not all about you isn't he right mindset. 

19. #3 You want people to come to you with new ideas, but you also want them to understand that 'new' doesn't necessarily mean 'right' and there are implications for being wrong. 

20. When faced with a situation where I don't have all the tools I would normally use to complete a project I...

* Wait till I can get all the tools I need.
* Improvise with what I have.
* Do what I can until I get to the part that needs the missing tool and let everyone know work will continue when I get the tool.
* Call a friend and ask to borrow their tool and start once I have it.

21. #2. A sense of creativity, learning. # #3 or #4 are also acceptable depending on what you're looking for.

22. Alice cannot swim; Bob cannot ride a bike; Charlie cannot run. In a team triathlon event, who performs the first, second, and last events?

* Charlie, Bob, Alice
* Bob, Charlie, Alice
* Alice, Charlie, Bob
* Bob, Alice, Charlie

23. #3. It is not a complicated situation, but it is one fraught with dangers. You want someone who is not going ot make it all about them, humility enough but also proud enough about their accomplishment to not downplay their contribution (imposter syndrome).

24. #2 if you want to leverage search; #3 if you are looking for determination.

25. #2. YPou're looking for someone who is willing and able to be a part of a team. To suborn their personal desire to be the hero and develop other members of the team. 

26. #3. Displays a sense of cooperation and empathy. 

27. #2. 

28. #4. Lying can only come back to haunt you; not acting on the truth may come back to haunt the boss, but that's part of the deal.

29. #1. 1000 is *roughly* 1024.

30. All of the above.
