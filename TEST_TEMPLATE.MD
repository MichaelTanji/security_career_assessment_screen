## Instructions

List the task, condition, and standards expected here. Add any supplemental languge required by your organization, or to help clarify anthing you feel is ambiguous or would benefit from elaboration.

## The Test

List 30 questions from the master list of questions, using at least three questions from each of the six categories. Increase the number of questions from any given category, depending on what emphasis you place on the given traits based on the role(s) you are hiring for. For example, in a situation where there is a high degree of ambiguity and abstraction, you may want to add more questions about ingenuity and fewer on X. 

List the questions in random order. Try not to place questions from the same category next to each other. **Do not list the category headings before the questions from those categories.** You're not trying to *trick* anyone, but by the same token you don't want to telegraph to the test takers that a given answer might be better suited to a given question based on the category being assessed.

## End of Test Instructions

Provide the test taker with any specific instructions they should follow with regards to turning in their answers, dealing with test-taking materials, communicating with other test takers, discussing test contents, etc.
