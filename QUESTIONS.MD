You’ve been making widgets for 10 years. Your family has made widgets going back five generations. By chance you meet someone who also makes widgets, but using a totally different technique and materials. Your response is: 

* Are you seriously going to tell me how to make widgets?
* I’ve never heard of widgets being made like that. How does it work?
* I’m not interested, but I’m glad it's working for you.
* Whatever you’re doing, it's not making widgets.

You get a job in a widget factory and as a part of your training are shown exactly the steps to take, and buttons to push on the widget making machine.

* Clean up and head for the parking lot.
* Throw some scrap widget material in the machine and see what those other 13 settings do.
* Talk to your supervisor to see if he’ll show you what those other 13 settings do.
* Dig out the widget machine manual and take it home to read.

How often do you teach yourself how to make or repair something?

* I rock YouTube how-to videos.
* I once tried to screw in a lightbulb. I mostly sit in the dark now.

* I'm not the handiest person in the world but I've been known to dable.

## Creativity

When I play with Legos...

* I build them according to the instructions.
* I bulid them according to the instructions and incorporate other bricks that I already have.
* I try to build them without the instructions, referring to them when I get stuck.
* I don't buy kits, I like building my own thing.
---
The boss always says his door is open to talk about new ideas and ways of doing things. Your take on this is:

* That’s what every boss says; they don’t mean it. They’re not going to mess with what got them where they are.
* Bob brought an idea to the boss once and a month later he was fired.
* Alice brought an idea to the boss once, they tried it, it worked, and all Alice got was a $100 gift card.
* Might as well give it a shot; if it works you're hero and if it doesn't you don't want to work in a place like this anyway.

* Call a friend and ask to borrow their tool and start once I have it.

## Determination

You’re in your doctor’s waiting room and the only thing to do to pass the time is a crossword in a children’s magazine. It is surprisingly difficult for the 8-12 year old audience it is supposed to be for:

* Keep at it until you’ve solved it. Tear out the puzzle page and take it home if you have to.*
* Do what you can and leave it for the next patient.
* Put it down and look at the tropical fish in the wall tank.
* Ask the receptionist for something else to read; you’re an adult for crying out loud!
---
You’ve got a solid GPA and great test scores. Your first choice for college rejected you, but you got into your safety school. Right now you’re feeling...

* Rejected and despondent.
* Let down but not worried. You can always try to transfer later.
* Disappointed. The Ivy League was the first step to life in the fast lane. I guess it's mediocrity FTW.
* There is always the Navy
---
At work, when you get done with your assigned tasks, your first instinct is to:

* Take on more work.
* Write some code, build a jig, or other task that will make your job easier.
* Help others with their work.
* Work on something you want to not have to.
---
You want to study X, but you can't afford to go to school full time. Your next step is:

* Try to get an entry-level job in a company that does X, even if it isn't directly involved in X.
* Find a commercial training/certification program in X. Its not as expensive as a degree but its better than nothing.

You just got your new flat-pack furniture home, opened the box, and found that two pages in the instructions are missing. Your next course of action is?

* Follow the directions as far as you can, and then test fit the remaining pieces to see if you can do it without directions.
* Call your brother in law over to help out; he bought the same piece of furniture six months ago.

## Humility

Your kids came home from school today with math homework. When they showed you how they were taught to solve math problems, it was not the same way you were taught. Your response is:

* Why do the schools have to mess with what works?
* I guess there is more than one way to skin a cat.
* I looked up this new method for teaching online and helped the kids with the work even though I disagreed with the approach.
* I taught the kids to do it my way and called the school for a parent-teacher conference.
---
You made a mistake but didn’t realize it at the time. The mistake became public and circumstances are such that someone else is getting all the blame. This is not a trivial matter and the repercussions could be severe.

* Better them than me.
* Reveal the source of the problem anonymously and without naming names. The problem will get fixed and no one has to get in trouble.
* Own up and take what’s coming.
* Admit that you had _a_ role in what happened, but spread the blame around. They can’t punish everyone.
---
You’re assigned to a project with two people who have less experience and skill than you do. Your first instinct is to:

* Start working and call on the other two people as needed.
* Find out the desired end state, assess the skill level of the other two, and break down tasks accordingly.
* Start work on the parts you want to work on and give the rest to the other two.
* Explain the risks of allowing inexperienced people to work on the project and ask for more senior people.

* Proud
* Ashamed
* Conflicted

---
You supervise a team of 10 people. One of them comes to you with a new idea for how to do their job. Your first instinct is to:

* Remind them that there is one approved way to do the job and that they could get in trouble for changing things.
* Point out the risks involved in doing things differently.
* Listen to the idea, assess its worthiness and compliance with organizational standards and goals, and if the risk is low, let them try.
* Explain the new idea to the other nine people and make sure they all adopt it. Let everyone benefit from the new approach.

## Empathy

A friend or family member comes to you because something they bought is not working properly, or at all. Your first instict is to:

* Tell them to read the manual or look up the issue online. In an age of instant information it is easier than ever for people to help themselves.
* Direct them to the manufacturer or service provider for help; they get paid for that sort of thing.
* Help them as best I can, looking up what the problem might be and working through the troubleshooting steps with them. This way they’re more comfortable solving problems on their own in the future.
* Take a quick look and tell them it's beyond repair and that they need a new one.

* 10: 5 people, 2 hands each.
* 5: Five people, five descriptions
* 1: How do you misinterpret what an elephant looks like, even if you can't see?
---
You’re briefing the boss about a problem. Failure to address the problem could lead to a material event. Is it OK to lie a little bit about how bad the problem is if you know the boss would otherwise blow it off?

* Yes. You’re the expert and your opinion on these matters should prevail.
* No. It's never OK to lie.
* Yes. Lying is not a crime. You’re doing the right thing.
* No. Your job is to inform. If company leadership wants to accept the risk, that’s on them.
